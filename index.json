However, its characteristics are irregular, with divergence in memory access and branch execution, so it cannot achieve maximum efficiency on GPUs. This paper proposes a novel Neural Intersection Function based on a multilayer perceptron whose core operation contains only dense matrix multiplication with predictable memory access. Our method is the first solution integrating the neural network-based approach and BVH-based ray tracing pipeline into one unified rendering framework. We can evaluate the visibility and occlusion of secondary rays without traversing the most irregular and time-consuming part of the BVH and thus accelerate ray casting. The experiments show the proposed method can reduce the secondary ray casting time for direct illumination by up to 35% compared to a BVH-based implementation and still preserve the image quality.","tags":[],"title":"Neural Intersection Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shin Fujieda","Takahiro Harada"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"3efe470b3b6ca507c4a0d271e1243402","permalink":"https://shinfj.github.io/publication/progressive-material-caching/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/progressive-material-caching/","section":"publication","summary":"The evaluation of material networks is a relatively resource-intensive process in the rendering pipeline. Modern production scenes can contain hundreds or thousands of complex materials with massive networks, so there is a great demand for an efficient way of handling material networks. In this paper, we introduce an efficient method for progressively caching the material nodes without an overhead on the rendering performance. We evaluate the material networks as usual in the rendering process. Then, the output value of part of the network is stored in a cache and can be used in the evaluation of the next materials. Using our method, we can render the scene with performance equal to or better than that of the method without caching, with a slight difference in the images rendered with caching and without it.","tags":[],"title":"Progressive Material Caching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shin Fujieda","Yusuke Tokuyoshi","Takahiro Harada"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648771200,"objectID":"79821a9b5bf184128265661b0ddbc28f","permalink":"https://shinfj.github.io/publication/stochastic-light-culling-for-single-scattering-in-participating-media/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stochastic-light-culling-for-single-scattering-in-participating-media/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a simple but efficient method to compute single scattering from point and arbitrarily shaped area light sources in participating media. Our method extends the stochastic light culling method to volume rendering by considering the intersection of a ray and spherical bounds of light influence ranges. For primary rays, this allows simple computation of the lighting in participating media without hierarchical data structures such as a light tree. First, we show how to combine equiangular sampling with the proposed light culling method in a simple case of point lights. We then apply it to arbitrarily shaped area lights by considering virtual point lights on the surface of area lights. Using our method, we are able to improve the rendering quality for scenes with many lights without tree construction and traversal.","tags":[],"title":"Stochastic Light Culling for Single Scattering in Participating Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Ximena Bastidas Rodriguez","Adrien Gruson","Luisa F.

Among many such algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved significant performance improvement in many challenging tasks. Since CNNs process images directly in the spatial domain, they are essentially spatial approaches. Given that spatial and spectral approaches are known to have different characteristics, it will be interesting to incorporate a spectral approach into CNNs. We propose a novel CNN architecture, wavelet CNNs, which combines a multiresolution analysis and CNNs into one model. Our insight is that a CNN can be viewed as a limited form of a multiresolution analysis. Based on this insight, we supplement missing parts of the multiresolution analysis via wavelet transform and integrate them as additional components in the entire architecture. Wavelet CNNs allow us to utilize spectral information which is mostly lost in conventional CNNs but useful in most image processing tasks. We evaluate the practical performance of wavelet CNNs on texture classification and image annotation. The experiments show that wavelet CNNs can achieve better accuracy in both tasks than existing models while having significantly fewer parameters than conventional CNNs.","tags":null,"title":"Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shin Fujieda","Kohei Takayama","Toshiya Hachisuka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1500854400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500854400,"objectID":"a500adc1ee1d183cd95f7a110c605452","permalink":"https://shinfj.github.io/publication/wavelet-convolutional-neural-networks-for-texture-classification/","publishdate":"2019-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wavelet-convolutional-neural-networks-for-texture-classification/","section":"publication","summary":"Texture classification is an important and challenging problem in many image processing applications.
