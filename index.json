Among many such algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved significant performance improvement in many challenging tasks. Since CNNs process images directly in the spatial domain, they are essentially spatial approaches. Given that spatial and spectral approaches are known to have different characteristics, it will be interesting to incorporate a spectral approach into CNNs. We propose a novel CNN architecture, wavelet CNNs, which combines a multiresolution analysis and CNNs into one model. Our insight is that a CNN can be viewed as a limited form of a multiresolution analysis. Based on this insight, we supplement missing parts of the multiresolution analysis via wavelet transform and integrate them as additional components in the entire architecture. Wavelet CNNs allow us to utilize spectral information which is mostly lost in conventional CNNs but useful in most image processing tasks. We evaluate the practical performance of wavelet CNNs on texture classification and image annotation. The experiments show that wavelet CNNs can achieve better accuracy in both tasks than existing models while having significantly fewer parameters than conventional CNNs.","tags":null,"title":"Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shin Fujieda","Kohei Takayama","Toshiya Hachisuka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1500854400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500854400,"objectID":"a500adc1ee1d183cd95f7a110c605452","permalink":"/publication/wavelet-convolutional-neural-networks-for-texture-classification/","publishdate":"2019-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wavelet-convolutional-neural-networks-for-texture-classification/","section":"publication","summary":"Texture classification is an important and challenging problem in many image processing applications. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved significant successes for image classification, texture classification remains a difficult problem since textures usually do not contain enough information regarding the shape of object. In image processing, texture classification has been traditionally studied well with spectral analyses which exploit repeated structures in many textures. Since CNNs process images as-is in the spatial domain whereas spectral analyses process images in the frequency domain, these models have different characteristics in terms of performance. We propose a novel CNN architecture, wavelet CNNs, which integrates a spectral analysis into CNNs. Our insight is that the pooling layer and the convolution layer can be viewed as a limited form of a spectral analysis. Based on this insight, we generalize both layers to perform a spectral analysis with wavelet transform. Wavelet CNNs allow us to utilize spectral information which is lost in conventional CNNs but useful in texture classification. The experiments demonstrate that our model achieves better accuracy in texture classification than existing models. We also show that our model has significantly fewer parameters than CNNs, making our model easier to train with less memory.","tags":null,"title":"Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks for Texture Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shin Fujieda","Toshihiko Yamasaki","Kiyoharu Aizawa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1457568000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1457568000,"objectID":"cee19826a291b39e146d6626114594e0","permalink":"/publication/efficient-human-pose-estimation-in-video-using-fast-object-detection/","publishdate":"2019-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/efficient-human-pose-estimation-in-video-using-fast-object-detection/","section":"publication","summary":"本研究では、カーネル密度推定を用いて1フレーム中の複数の姿勢候補を統合するだけでなく、動画の時間連続性を考慮して前後フレームの姿勢推定結果も統合することで、より高精度に人物の姿勢推定を行う方法を提案する。さらに、高速に一般物体検出を行うための手法であるFaster R-CNNを用いてフレーム中の人物位置の特定を行うことにより、処理の高速化を図る。提案手法の有効性を確認するためにTED講演会で行われた複数の講演の動画に対して2つの既存手法と提案手法による推定を行った。結果として、提案手法はおよそ60%の精度で、既存手法に比べて3.4%~5.0%高精度に人物の姿勢推定を行うことができ、処理速度はおよそ2倍になることを示した。","tags":null,"title":"Efficient Human Pose Estimation in Video using Fast Object Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shin Fujieda","Toshihiko Yamasaki","Kiyoharu Aizawa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448928000,"objectID":"e383d3105499f566c973ce5c78c49859","permalink":"/publication/human-pose-estimation-in-video-considering-temporal-consistency/","publishdate":"2019-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/human-pose-estimation-in-video-considering-temporal-consistency/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a method to estimate a human pose in videos considering temporal consistency.
